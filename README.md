# Tetris Optimization Project

## About
The Tetris Optimization Project explores the application of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to optimize Tetris piece placement. Tetris is a globally recognized and beloved computer game known for its simple yet addictive gameplay. This project aims to enhance the efficiency of Tetris gameplay by integrating the ACO algorithm, inspired by the collaborative foraging behavior of ants in nature. By leveraging the ACO algorithm, we seek to develop AI agents capable of making strategic decisions in real-time Tetris scenarios, ultimately improving the overall gaming experience for players. Additionally, this project includes a comparative analysis between the ACO algorithm and a modified genetic algorithm to evaluate their respective effectiveness in optimizing Tetris gameplay.
